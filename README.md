# MM_standard_compressed

An essential and compressed Majora Mask Randomizer layout for gossip stones tracker. This tracker was idealized to be played with the lastest standard settings from the MMR community.

## Installation

If you play OOTR, ** DO NOT use a single application (gossip stones tracker) for both games ** . The reason is because some files are named after OOT in order to keep all functionalities such as dragging songs to its verified checks as weel keeping the hints consistent. Make sure to have applciation separated for each game. 

1. Download the .zip file and extract it.

2. Copy all content to your Gossip Stones Tracker folder.

3. Make sure to change layouts to "egodev" in the file "settings" in your base folder.

## Usage tips

a. All locations have a lowercase abrreviation shortcut, which comes from MMR region's text name for both woth and foolish. Also, preopositions between region words were considered (see example below). With one exception, you can follow these rules to find the desired location: 
  1. Region has a single word: Just type the first three characters. Ex: Woofall -> woo
  2. Region has two words: Type the first character from the first word, plus the two first characters from the second word. Examples:
    . Pirate Interior -> pin
    . Pirate Sewers -> pse
    . Snowhead Temple -> ste
    Exception: Ikana Canyon -> ico (because ica is reserved for Ikana Castle)
  3. Region has three words: the first character of each word. Ex: Great Bay Coast -> gbc, Path To Snowhead -> pts 
b. The Gibdo mask is an upgrade from Garo Mask.
c. In the gossip stones, just click on it to cycle between Gold Dust, Chateau Romani, Letter to Kafei and Express to Mama.
d. The right empty boxes are intended to be used as free places to remember an item's location. For sometimes hints, use the lower boxes.
