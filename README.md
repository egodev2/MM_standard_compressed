## Installation

If you play OOTR, DO NOT use a single application (gossip stones tracker) for both games. The reason is because some files are named after OOT in order to keep all functionalities such as dragging songs to its verified checks as weel keeping the hints consistent. Make sure an application for each game. 

1. Download the .zip file and extract it.

2. Copy all content to your Gossip Stones Tracker folder.

3. Make sure to change layouts to "egodev" in the file "settings" in your base folder.
